------- NICETEXT : How-to-get-started -------

******************* BEGINNER ************

1. Do a "gmake install"  (If you don't have gmake and a GNU C++ compiler
   for your system then read the PORTING file for more details.)

2. Read the DESCRIPTION section of the man pages for "nttpd", 
   "nicetext", and "scramble". 
   (either "more man/cat1/nttpd.1" or "man nttpd") 

3. Try running the "bin/qstart-nttpd" shell-script 

4. Point your favorite browser to http://localhost:2119/

Be aware that there is MUCH more to the software than the nttpd program, 
but it is the quickest way to get a flavor for what this system can do.

******************* INTERMEDIATE ************

5. Try using the "nicetext" and "scramble" programs from the command-line.
   The "examples/database" directory has some very large dictionaries
   and style sources.

6. Next, walk through the "examples/tutorial" which shows how to make 
   and use custom dictionaries and style-sources.

******************* ADVANCED ************

7. If you cannot get enough of this neat software, then you can read the
   papers in the "doc" directory.

8. If you have enough system resources then you can remake the dictionaries 
   and style-sources in "examples/database" from "examples/words" and 
   "examples/texts".   

9. If you are completely absorbed by this software, you should then try
   to make your own style-sources. You can also try to create very large and 
   complex custom dictionaries.  

10. If you want to make this work with other natural languages, simply 
   modify the lexical scanner to recognize different letters.  (Of course,
   you must follow the rules described in the papers for the tranformations
   to work, but it should not be that hard!)

(Right now, there are no questions because this is the first public release!)
