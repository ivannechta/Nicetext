.TH LISTWORD 1L "Aug 17, 1998 (v0.9)" NICETEXT 
.SH NAME
listword
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B listword
.RB [\-c\] 
.RB [\-l\]
.RB [\-p\]
.RB [[\-u\ updateFreq] | [\-q\]]
.RB [\-x\]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I listword
creates word-lists from sample natural-language texts.  It uses the
same parser as the
.B scramble(1L)
program in the
.B NICETEXT
system.

It reads input from stdin and sends the output to stdout.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI -c
Print word frequency along with each unique word to stdout. 
.TP
.BI -l 
Convert all words to lower-case.
.TP
.BI -p
Print words as they are read.  This changes the behavior of 
.I listword
so that it does not keep track of frequency.  It does not print any status
information to stderr if the
.B -p
parameter is set. 
This is extremely useful when creating 
.B NICETEXT
scanners for other natural-languages.  
.TP
.BI \-u\ updateFreq 
Print status updates to stderr every
.I updateFreq
sentences.  Use zero to disable updates.

The status shows the number of unique words read and the total number
of words read.
.TP
.BI -q
Be quiet.  This is the same as
.B -u 0
.TP
.BI -x
Exclude non-words (numbers, punctuation, etc.).
.SH "EXAMPLES"
It is strongly suggested that you try the examples in the
.B tutorial 
directory of the
.B NICETEXT
distribution.
For further information, please read the documentation in the 
.B doc 
directory.
