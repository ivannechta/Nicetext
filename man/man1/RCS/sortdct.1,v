.SH NAME
sortdct
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sortdct
.RB [\-e\ errorLevel]
.RB [\-q\]
.RB [\-r\]
.RB [\-u\ updateFreq]
.RB [\-x\] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I sortdct
converts type-word lists into a sorted merged-type-word lists
suitable for processing by the
.B dct2mstr(1L)
program in the
.B NICETEXT
system.  The purpose is to help create new dictionaries for use with
.I nicetext(1L)
and 
.I scramble(1L)

A type-word list is simply a text file where there is one record per line.
The word follows the type definition of the word on each line. 
.I sortdct
makes sure that each word only occurs once on the output.  If a word is defined
multiple times in the type-word list then 
.I sortdct
creates a new "merged-type" category for that word.  The way to merge types 
is to simply concatenate the list of types for a word in alphabetical order
separated by a comma.  For example, if the word "bill" is both a "male_name"
and an "object", then the merged type would be "male_name,object".

It reads input from stdin and sends the output to stdout.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI \-e\ errorLevel
Print error messages up to 
.I errorlevel.  
The default of 1 is probably best on a scale of 0 to 9.  (0 disables errors
reporting.) The messages relate to words that cannot be parsed by the scanner used in both
.B scramble
and
.B listword.
.TP 
.BI -q
Be quiet.  Do NOT print status updates or errors.  This is the same as
.B -u 0 -e 0.
.TP
.BI -r
Rerun option: input should be the output of a previous run.  The difference
is that the commas as interpreted as merged types in the input file.  Otherwise,
it ignores the entries with commas in the type.
.TP
.BI \-u\ updateFreq
Print a count of the number of input lines processed to stderr every
.I updateFreq
lines. 
.TP
.BI -x
Expand the dictionary by adding suffixes to every word and type such as "s", 
"ing", "ly", etc.  This was an experiment used early in the development of the
.B NICETEXT
system for English. It has since been replaced with the "import" concept of
.I impkimmo(1L), impwbstr(1L), 
etc. 
.SH "EXAMPLES"
It is strongly suggested that you try the examples in the
.B tutorial 
directory of the
.B NICETEXT
distribution.
For further information, please read the documentation in the 
.B doc 
directory.
