       _s_o_r_t_d_c_t	converts  type-word  lists  into a sorted merged-
       type-word   lists   suitable   for   processing	 by   the
       ddcctt22mmssttrr((11LL))  program in the NNIICCEETTEEXXTT system.  The purpose
       is to help create new  dictionaries  for  use  with  _n_i_c_e_-
       _t_e_x_t_(_1_L_) and _s_c_r_a_m_b_l_e_(_1_L_)

       A  type-word list is simply a text file where there is one
       record per line.  The word follows the type definition  of
       the  word on each line.	_s_o_r_t_d_c_t makes sure that each word
       only occurs once on the output.	If a word is defined mul-
       tiple  times  in the type-word list then _s_o_r_t_d_c_t creates a
       new "merged-type" category for  that  word.   The  way  to
       merge types is to simply concatenate the list of types for
       a word in alphabetical order separated by  a  comma.   For
       example,  if  the word "bill" is both a "male_name" and an
       "object",    then    the    merged    type    would     be
       "male_name,object".

       It  reads input from stdin and sends the output to stdout.

	      Print error messages up to _e_r_r_o_r_l_e_v_e_l_.  The default
	      of  1  is  probably  best on a scale of 0 to 9.  (0
	      disables errors reporting.) The messages relate  to
	      words  that cannot be parsed by the scanner used in
	      both ssccrraammbbllee and lliissttwwoorrdd..

       --qq     Be quiet.  Do NOT print status updates  or  errors.
	      This is the same as --uu 00 --ee 00..

       --rr     Rerun  option: input should be the output of a pre-
	      vious run.  The difference is that  the  commas  as
	      interpreted  as  merged  types  in  the input file.
	      Otherwise, it ignores the entries  with  commas  in
	      the type.

       --uu uuppddaatteeFFrreeqq
	      Print  a	count  of  the number of input lines pro-
	      cessed to stderr every _u_p_d_a_t_e_F_r_e_q lines.

       --xx     Expand the dictionary by adding suffixes	to  every
	      word  and type such as "s", "ing", "ly", etc.  This
	      was an experiment used early in the development  of
	      the  NNIICCEETTEEXXTT system for English. It has since been
	      replaced with the "import" concept of _i_m_p_k_i_m_m_o_(_1_L_)_,
	      _i_m_p_w_b_s_t_r_(_1_L_)_, etc.
