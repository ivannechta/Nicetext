       _s_c_r_a_m_b_l_e converts text-files  containing  natural-language
       text into binary files.

       If  nniicceetteexxtt((11LL))  was  the  author of the text file and if
       ssccrraammbbllee is using the same dictionary that  nniicceetteexxtt  used
       then  ssccrraammbbllee  will recover the original input from nniiccee--
       tteexxtt..  Otherwise, ssccrraammbbllee is a pretty useless program.

       Note that although ssccrraammbbllee is  the  inverse  function  of
       nniicceetteexxtt  , nniicceetteexxtt is NOT the inverse function of ssccrraamm--
       bbllee..

       Also note that certain modification can	be  made  to  the
       output  of  nniicceetteexxtt  that will not effect the ability for
       ssccrraammbbllee to recover  the  original  input.   For  example,
       punctuation,  whitespace,  and uppercase/lowercase conver-
       sion will not make  any	difference.   Furthermore,  words
       that  are not in the dictionary may be freely added to the
       text without any  problems.   Finally,  any  text  may  be
       appended to the _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t_.

       It  is  strongly recommended that you go through the tuto-
       rial supplied with  the	software.   It	demonstrates  the
       flexibility in defining dictionaries and style sources for
       _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t generation. The .ps or	.pdf  files  in  the  doc
       directory  of  the distribution contain detailed papers on
       the theory of operation, etc.

       --dd ddiiccttiioonnaarryy
	      Use _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y as the prefix to select the  dictio-
	      nary definition database.

	      The default _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y is _m_s_t_r

       --ee     Print undefined words to stderr.	 The lliissttwwoorrdd((11LL))
	      program is another way to do this.

       --ii iinnppuuttFFiillee
	      Read sample natural-language texts from  _i_n_p_u_t_F_i_l_e_.
	      The default is stdin.

       --oo oouuttppuuttFFiillee
	      Send the scrambled output to this file name.

	      into  RAM  before  processing.	The   --ss   option
	      instructs the software to read each record from the
	      database tables on disk during analysis.	The  pri-
	      mary  advantage is that the software has a signifi-
	      cantly smaller memory footprint.	Another advantage
	      is that you do not need to wait to load the dictio-
	      nary into RAM - which can take some time.  The dis-
	      advantage  is  that processing of large input files
	      is significantly slower.

	      Use this option if you are processing a  relatively
	      small  input  file or if you get memory errors when
	      running without --ss set.
