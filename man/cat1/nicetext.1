       _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t  is a program that converts any file into pseudo-
       natural-language text.

       A companion program (_s_c_r_a_m_b_l_e(1L)), converts the  natural-
       language  text  back into the original file as long as the
       _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y is the same for both applications.

       The _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t program may generate  different  pseudo-natu-
       ral-language  texts  for the same input file with the same
       dictionary.

       It is strongly recommended that you go through  the  tuto-
       rial  supplied  with  the  software.   It demonstrates the
       flexibility in defining dictionaries and style sources for
       _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t  generation.  The  .ps	or  .pdf files in the doc
       directory of the distribution contain detailed  papers  on
       the theory of operation, etc.

       If  you are looking for a quick demonstration, try running
       the  _q_s_t_a_r_t_-_n_t_t_p_d  shell-script.   You  may  then  go   to
       http://localhost:2119/  with  your favorite browser to try
       some transformations.

       --dd ddiiccttiioonnaarryy
	      Use _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y as the prefix to select the  dictio-
	      nary definition database.  For example: _m_s_t_r speci-
	      fies the database in the files  _m_s_t_r_d_i_c_t_._d_a_t  _m_s_t_r_-
	      _d_i_c_t_._a_l_t _m_s_t_r_d_i_c_t_._j_m_p _m_s_t_r_t_y_p_e_._d_a_t _m_s_t_r_t_y_p_e_._a_l_t and
	      _m_s_t_r_t_y_p_e_._j_m_p You may also include directory  infor-
	      mation  in the prefix: _~_/_m_y_d_i_c_t_/_s_h_a_k would point to
	      _~_/_m_y_d_i_c_t_/_s_h_a_k_d_i_c_t_._d_a_t _~_/_m_y_d_i_c_t_/_s_h_a_k_d_i_c_t_._j_m_p etc.

	      The default _d_i_c_t_i_o_n_a_r_y is _m_s_t_r

	      See sortdct(1L) and dct2mstr(1L) , to learn how  to
	      create the proper format dictionary tables.

       --gg ggrraammmmaarr
	      Use  the	_g_r_a_m_m_a_r defined in this (fully qualified)
	      file name as the style-source.

	      Note that --gg and --mm are mutually exclusive.

	      This is the file	that  will  be	used  for  input.
	      Right  now,  _n_i_c_e_t_e_x_t  is not designed to work with
	      non-file streams because it stores  the  length  of
	      the file within the pseudo-natural-language output.

       --ll mmaaxxMMooddeellLLeennggtthh
	      This is the maximum sentence-model length that will
	      be  used if you are using a grammar-definition file
	      ((--gg)) for a style-source.	This is important,  since
	      cyclic  grammars	could  produce	an infinitly long
	      sentence model which would  take	forever  to  com-
	      plete!

	      Note  that  the  length  of a sentence model counts
	      punctuation as elements in the sentence model.

	      The default value is 1024.

       --mm mmooddeell
	      Use _m_o_d_e_l as the prefix to select the  style-source
	      definition  database.   For example: _m_s_t_r specifies
	      the database in the files _m_s_t_r_m_o_d_e_l_._d_a_t  and  _m_s_t_r_-
	      _m_o_d_e_l_._j_m_p  You  may also include directory informa-
	      tion in the prefix: _~_/_m_y_m_o_d_e_l_s_/_s_h_a_k would point  to
	      _~_/_m_y_m_o_d_e_l_s_/_s_h_a_k_m_o_d_e_l_._d_a_t	  and	 _~_/_m_y_m_o_d_e_l_s_/_s_h_a_k_-
	      _m_o_d_e_l_._j_m_p

	      The default _m_o_d_e_l is _m_s_t_r

	      See (_g_e_n_m_o_d_e_l(1L)), to find out how to create  cus-
	      tom sentence-model style sources from sample texts.

	      Note that --gg and --mm are mutually exclusive.

       --oo oouuttppuuttFFiillee
	      Send the pseudo-natural-language text to _o_u_t_p_u_t_F_i_l_e
	      The default is standard output.

       --ss     Normally,  the  software	loads all database tables
	      into  RAM  before  processing.	The   --ss   option
	      instructs the software to read each record from the
	      database tables on  disk	during	text  generation.
	      The  primary  advantage  is that the software has a
	      significantly smaller  memory  footprint.   Another
	      advantage  is  that you do not need to wait to load
	      the dictionary into RAM - which can take some time.
	      The  disadvantage is that processing of large input
	      files is significantly slower.

	      Use this option if you are processing a  relatively
	      small  input  file or if you get memory errors when
	      running without --ss set.

	      Print status updates  to	stder  revery  _u_p_d_a_t_e_F_r_e_q
	      sentences.  Use zero to disable updates.

	      The  following  is  the  definition  of  the status
	      information:


	      I:     Number of input bits read.

	      E:     Number of extra bits appended  to	input  to
		     complete the last sentence model.

	      O:     Number of output bits written.

	      G:     Growth ration (100*0)/(I+E)

	      U:     Number of models used.

	      S:     Number  of  models skipped because more than
		     --ll mmaaxxMMooddeellLLeennggtthh elements were generated by
		     the grammar in --gg ggrraammmmaarr

	      N:     Total number of model elements used.

	      A:     Average number of elements per model.

       --qq     Be quiet.  This is the same as --uu 00

       A classic example:

	      nicetext -i /etc/passwd -m shak -d shak -s

       converts the /etc/passwd file into pseudo-Shakespeare.

	      nicetext -i /etc/passwd -m jfk -d jfk -s

       converts   the  /etc/passwd  file  into	random	sentences
       inspired by JFK's inaugural address.
