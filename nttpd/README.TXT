---- WORK IN PROGRESS -- NOT READY FOR USE ----

In case you were wondering, this directory contains some thoughts as to 
making an HTML interface to the entire package.

So far, only part of the hack works.
 
Come to think of it, it would be quite easy to do CGI.  

But hey, isn't it more fun to implement a small part of the HTTP/1.0
specification instead?

See the man pages for nttpd(1L) for details.
