----- NICETEXT -- How to PORT ------

********* Where does it work now? ***********

This system was developed on FreeBSD using GNU C++.

It is also known to compile and run on LINUX (x86) and 
Digital UNIX using gcc and gmake.

********* I want to compile it on another UNIX ***********

If you want to port it to another UNIX-like operating system,
simply get gmake and gcc.  It will probably compile and run with 
no modifications.

If you do not have gmake but have gcc it will probably work with some simple
changes to the makefiles -- (i.e. call "make" instead of "gmake"...). 

The "lex" and "yacc" programs were used to create several ".cc" files.
The dependencies on the ".l" and ".y" programs still exist but the
"clean" target should not delete the resulting ".cc" files.  

If you do not have gcc then it should compile with minor modifications
using any ANSI-C++ compiler.   (For example, the mtc++ module has been
ported to DOS with minimal effort!)

********* I want to compile it on my non-UNIX desktop-OS ***********

If there is enough demand, we will port it to the Windows and NT platforms.
It should not be that difficult, but we want to try this on the UNIX population
first.  

********* Are there static-binaries available for my platform? **********

If you successfully port the software then please send us a copy of the
steps you took to make it happen along with any patches.  If there is enough 
interest then we may provide user-compiled binaries for many architectures.
