---- NICETEXT TUTORIAL ----- 

This directory contains several tutorials to demonstrate the use of the 
NICETEXT system.  These very small examples are meant to get you started.

Each numbered subdirectory contains a README.TXT that walks you through
the tutorial.  The individual commands for each step are located in each 
Makefile.  

If the binaries from the NICETEXT distribution are not in your path,
you may setenv NICETEXT_BIN_DIR /usr/local/bin/ or whatever.
(Don't forget to append a trailing / ).

If you do not have permission to write into these directories then
you must make a copy.  The "gmake mycopy" command will attempt to make
a copy of this directory tree into your $HOME/nicetext/tutorial  

Don't forget that the NICETEXT system does come with some rather large
dictionaries that are already created in the "database" directory.  
THE READ-ONLY VERSIONS OF THE database/*.jmp, *.alt, and *.dat FILES 
WORK VERY WELL WITH THE NICETEXT AND SCRAMBLE PROGRAMS.

Also, man pages are available for all NICETEXT commands.  

Most people will just use "nicetext" and "scramble".
