---- NICETEXT (large) EXAMPLE DIRECTORY ----

Getting started:

This directory contains several examples to demonstrate the use of the 
NICETEXT system.  

If you do not have permission to write into these directories then
you might start by making a personal copy of just the TUTORIAL. 

"cd tutorial; gmake mycopy" 

If the binaries from the NICETEXT distribution are not in your path,
you may setenv NICETEXT_BIN_DIR /usr/local/bin/ or whatever.
(Don't forget to append a trailing / ).

The "gmake mycopy" command in the current directory will make a copy of 
the full example directory tree into your $HOME/nicetext.  This is probably
unnecessary unless you are going to rebuild the existing large dictionaries
and style sources.  Otherwise, nicetext and scramble can use read-only
copies of these files.  (The database directory can be quite large!)
