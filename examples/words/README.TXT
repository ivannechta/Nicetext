NOTE:
YOU DO NOT NEED THIS DIRECTORY UNLESS YOU ARE RECREATING THE MASTER DICTIONARY
IN ../database.
 
****************

The purpose of the twlist (type-word list) is to create the dictionaries 
in ../database.

The twlist comes from several locations.
Some twlists are the output of the ../import modules. 
Others were downloaded from the Internet.
Still others were manually entered.

The purpose of wlist is to contain a list of words that drive the import
modules.
